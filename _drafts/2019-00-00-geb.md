Notes from _Gödel, Escher, Bach_:
- Self-reference, e.g. Epimenides' "This sentence is false"
- the record player metaphor
- 'beyond words' is not beyond words

    Godel's   Theorem   appears   as   Proposition   VI   in   his   1931   paper   "On   Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I." It states: To  every  w-consistent  recursive  class  K  of  formulae  there  correspond  recursive  class-signs r, such that neither v Gen r nor  Neg (v Gen r) belongs to Fig (K) (where v is the free variable of r). 

Actually,  it  was  in  German,  and  perhaps  you  feel  that  it  might  as  well  be  in  German  
anyway. So here is a paraphrase in more normal English: 
All consistent axiomatic formulations of number theory 
include undecidable propositions.
