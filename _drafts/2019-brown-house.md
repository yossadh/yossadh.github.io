Someone once said that everyone has a story. When I think of my story, my thoughts swarm towards the house of Oma and Opa, my maternal grandparents, who lived in the same city as our family, in Surabaya, probably about half an hour’s drive away.

//

In the brown house, Oma and Opa, my maternal grandparents, lived.

In my memories, the house was always brown, not in decrepit way, but more of a nostalgia-inducing sepia. It laid in the end of a ‘blind’ alley, the alley being blinded by a large house, fortress-like, and the brown house is exactly perpendicular to the large house’s tall gates.

The house had a large terrace overlooking quite a narrow front yard. At the corner, there was a mango tree, its fruit always never sweet, but mouth-puckeringly sour.

Typically we would go to Opa and Oma’s on Sundays after church, I also remember them driving over to our home, Opa still strong enough to drive, although battered by old age and cigarettes. I have fond memories of Opa, a typical doting grandparent who bought us anything that our parents wouldn’t. One thing that Opa bought for us was comic books. Our favourite was Doraemon manga, where the titular character is a robot cat who comes from the future. There was a time that it was the ritual to go with Opa and Oma to the big bookstore to get the latest Doraemon.

One childhood anecdote that Papa loves to tell me is that my older brother was reading a Doraemon tankoubon, and although I was too small to be able to read, I was apparently reading along with my brother and even laughed at the appropriate places. Papa would then conclude that that was when he knew I was a clever child.

About Oma, though, I can’t recall memories as fond as those of Opa. She was a constant presence along with Opa, sure, and I do remember her cooking grandmotherly meals, like oxtail soup. There might be once that Oma packed my brother and I into a hired tricycle rickshaw and bought groceries in a nearby supermarket. I actually cannot tell whether this is my own happy memory or something my mother said that I take to be my own. Perhaps my impressions were superseded by those in her later years, which, bless her, were filled with mental ailings.

Once on a Sunday lunch with friends, someone threw this conversational prompt: if you can travel back in time, who would you like to meet? I gave it some thought and although initially I thought of famous people in history, my thoughts gravitated to Oma. The Oma that my Mom talked about, still, even now, and the Oma of my childhood, are two very different people. I would want to meet Oma, now that I understand more of her demons, the person she was before they plagued her mind, as the person I am now who has seen more of the world than before. I am ashamed not to remember her with dignity, as a person who has made her choices and is a significant part of who I am as a person. Instead, I have shameful, even worse, indifferent, remembrance of her in her last few years. I remembered when Mom told me the news of her death by phone. I was already away from home then, and this was a year or two since. Mom actually delayed the news until after I finished my exams so that I won’t be emotionally affected. Shamefully, I was indifferent. My Mom’s voice on the phone did not betray any emotion. I remember at Opa’s funeral, Mom wailed when his body was set alight on fire in the cremation pyre. But there on the line, she spoke calmly, the funeral being over already by a few months. Oh, I told myself, their sufferings are now over. Oma’s and Mom’s both.

Oma came to live with us after Opa died. Mom is the youngest sibling of four and she was the only one still living in the same city, so Oma naturally came to our house. Oma’s conditions, both physical and mental, gradually gave. She had a fall which shattered her pelvic bones. She soon gave up walking on a crutch or a walker and laid down all day. She talked to herself and called Opa's name in the darkness of night.

Let me tell you something else about the brown house. Going in from the terrace, one would encounter the living room. On the left were the bedrooms, on the right going in from the garage was a study. Straight in from the living room was the dining room, further still a kitchen and an open space to sun the laundry. I remember this open space particularly well, because my aunt, Mom’s elder sister, had one of her wedding rites there. I said ‘rites’, because when she married my uncle, a Briton, they decided to honour the Indonesian culture by performing a traditional Javanese rite of marriage. I was still very small back then, but my brother and I certainly played a role, because we were dressed in traditional Javanese costumes, as did the bride and the groom. I didn’t exactly remember which rite it was, but it was a purification ritual, where the elders in the family poured flower-infused water on the couple. This was done inside the house at that roofless section, beneath the blue sky.

Let me tell you what happened to the brown house once Oma came to live with us and it was thus not lived.

When Oma passed away, all Mom’s elders siblings agreed to bequeath the brown house to her. She took care of Oma, after all, and since our family was not exactly well-to-do, it was received with gratitude. Around this time, my elder brother wanted to study abroad. This was not unusual in Indonesia where good education was scarce, but one needs the wherewithal. I was already studying in high school abroad, but this was on scholarship. So I wasn’t there, but from what my parents related, this was a time of hardship. Brother even went for German and Dutch lessons at some point, and after intensive English lessons and passing IELTS he was finally accepted in a school in Australia. But we still didn’t have the money. Dad then made a brave, some say reckless, decision. We have the money from selling the brown house, and it was enough for brother’s tuition fee for a year, so Dad will let brother go, but would brother be able to cope and work to earn the remaining tuition fee. Out of bravery or folly or both, brother said yes and went. In Surabayan Javanese, this was bondo nekat, which doesn't translate well, but I would attempt: it is the state where one has nothing left but one’s bravado; tell a drowning man not to grasp at straws.

The brown house thus has three generations’ worth of feelings.
