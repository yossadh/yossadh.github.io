My PhD supervisor prophetically said to me back in 2013 to learn Python. I did heed his advice and looked up some tutorials but soon abandoned it since it was not directly relevant to what I was doing. Now that Python is all the buzz, I feel a tinge of regret for not persisting to learn Python. I do believe the ability to code is now essential for a scientist regardless of fields, but especially in biology where we encounter growing size of data. This Nature article <[Programming: Pick up Python](https://www.nature.com/news/programming-pick-up-python-1.16833)> lays out this argument in more details with some resources for you to begin picking up Python.

I did pick up Python starting late last year, right after my thesis defense, while waiting for my work visa. While it is true that many resources and tutorials are out there, since Python is a popular language, I often found that the tutorials are more geared towards software developers. Scientists often do not need the full-blown Python capabilities or follow certain style guidelines, since we often write small scripts with fewer than 100 lines, instead of a big software.

So here I am listing some points that I pick up from learning Python, and mention some features that you probably do not need, but of course you can always find out more if you need them. Some of the points are not Python-specific, but good coding practices and/or 'philosophy' of sorts (try googling [Zen of Python](http://wiki.c2.com/?PythonPhilosophy), for example). 

### Learning points for scientists from coding:
- code documentation
- naming files, variables, functions
- object types: int, float, str
- conditional and loop statements
- functions and abstractions
- code review and refactoring
- file I/O (opening, reading, and writing file)
- Python-specific:
  - object types: list, tuple, set, dictionary
  - list comprehension
  - packages: sys, os, math, numpy
- So far don't need: assertion, exception

My own favourite Python tutorials:
- [Software Carpentry tutorials](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/), also for UNIX shell and git  
- [How to think like a computer scientist](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html)
