### Background / Intro
Since I defended my thesis last year, I've been working as postdoctoral research fellow where I have been doing mostly molecular docking for enzyme engineering. The position is quite unique since I am the only computational biologist / structural bioinformatician in a research group that does mostly wet-lab biochemistry. While it is exciting, one of the foremost challenges is how to communicate our ideas to collaborate effectively across our disciplines. While I have some wet-lab experience (in fact, that might be why I got the position in the first place) and have rough ideas about it, my colleagues may have less idea of what I'm doing, hence this post.

This post is intended to be eventually repurposed into a bridge-the-gap kind of talk in our group meeting. Here goes.

### Can I use computational biology tool X for my project?

I get asked this quite often.
