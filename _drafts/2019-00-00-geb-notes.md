I have finished reading Douglas Hofstadter's _Gödel, Escher, Bach_, though I still don't know how to answer the question "What is it about?" in one sentence. I guess I can say it's mostly about Gödel's incompleteness theorem, but then I dread the rejoinder "Really? All 700+ pages of it?".

Maybe instead of trying to tell, I would show you my notes instead. Take a gander. 

### Notes from _Gödel, Escher, Bach_  
- 
<blockquote>Godel's   Theorem   appears   as   Proposition   VI   in   his   1931   paper   "On   Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I." It states:  
<blockquote>To  every  w-consistent  recursive  class  K  of  formulae  there  correspond  recursive  class-signs r, such that neither v Gen r nor  Neg (v Gen r) belongs to Fig (K) (where v is the free variable of r).</blockquote>    
Actually,  it  was  in  German,  and  perhaps  you  feel  that it might as well be in German anyway. So here is a paraphrase in more normal English:   
<blockquote>All consistent axiomatic formulations of number theory include undecidable propositions.</blockquote> </blockquote>

- <blockquote>The adjective "meaningless" is not meaningless  </blockquote> 
  I found another example: "beyond words" is not beyond words

Self-reference, e.g. Epimenides' "This sentence is false"

the record player metaphor
