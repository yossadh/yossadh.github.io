I have finished reading Douglas Hofstadter's _Gödel, Escher, Bach_, though I still don't know how to answer the question "What is it about?" in one sentence. I guess I can say it's mostly about Gödel's incompleteness theorem, but then I dread the rejoinder "Really? All 700+ pages of it?".

Maybe instead of trying to tell, I would show you my notes instead. Take a gander. 

### Notes from _Gödel, Escher, Bach_  
#### Preface to _GEB_'s Twentieth-anniversary Edition
> ...<i>GEB</i> is a very personal attempt to say how it is that animate beings can come out of inanimate matter.

> What is an "I", and why are such things found (at least so far) only in association with, as poet Russell Edson once wonderfully phrased it, "teetering bulbs of dread and dream"... 

> ..."strange loop" notion holds the key to unraveling the mystery that we conscious beings call "being" or "consciousness".

> ...the Gödelian strange loop that arises in formal systems in mathematics (_i.e._, collections of rules churning out an endless series of mathematical truths solely by mechanical symbol-shunting without any regard to meanings or ideas hidden in the shapes being manipulated) is a loop that allows such a system to "perceive itself", to talk about itself, to become "self-aware", and in a sense it would not be going too far to say that by virtue of having such a loop, aformal system _acquires a self_.

> Meaning comes in despite one's best effort to keep symbols meaningless!


#### Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering
The actual wording of the theorem is apparently not for mortal eyes, that's why we need 700+ pages, okay?
<blockquote>Godel's   Theorem   appears   as   Proposition   VI   in   his   1931   paper   "On   Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I." It states:  
<blockquote>To  every  w-consistent  recursive  class  K  of  formulae  there  correspond  recursive  class-signs r, such that neither v Gen r nor  Neg (v Gen r) belongs to Fig (K) (where v is the free variable of r).</blockquote>  
Actually,  it  was  in  German,  and  perhaps  you  feel  that it might as well be in German anyway. So here is a paraphrase in more normal English:   
<blockquote>All consistent axiomatic formulations of number theory include undecidable propositions.</blockquote> 
(p. 25)
</blockquote>

- <blockquote>The adjective "meaningless" is not meaningless  </blockquote> 
  I found another example: "beyond words" is not beyond words

Self-reference, e.g. Epimenides' "This sentence is false"

the record player metaphor

strange loop

I think Godel's Theorem touches some very fundamental fabric of reality, that in discussing it, we would inevitably meander to deep topics such as the origin of consciousness, as Hofstadter has done.

how i came to read this book: pycon talk

Again, "So, what is it about?", here is my best attempt: It's about Gödel's incompleteness theorem, explained in relation to parallels found in Escher's works and Bach's fugues, with implications and meanderings from from formal systems in mathematics, the nature of consciousness, to artificial intelligence.

"Can you explain to me what is Gödel's incompleteness theorem?" Well... just read the book will you?
