I have finished reading Douglas Hofstadter's _Gödel, Escher, Bach_, though I still don't know how to answer the question "What is it about?" in one sentence. I guess I can say it's mostly about Gödel's incompleteness theorem, but then I dread the rejoinder "Really? All 700+ pages of it?".

Maybe instead of trying to tell, I would show you my notes instead. Take a gander. 
 
#### Preface to _GEB_'s Twentieth-anniversary Edition
> ...<i>GEB</i> is a very personal attempt to say how it is that animate beings can come out of inanimate matter.

> What is an "I", and why are such things found (at least so far) only in association with, as poet Russell Edson once wonderfully phrased it, "teetering bulbs of dread and dream"... 

> ..."strange loop" notion holds the key to unraveling the mystery that we conscious beings call "being" or "consciousness".

> ...the Gödelian strange loop that arises in formal systems in mathematics (_i.e._, collections of rules churning out an endless series of mathematical truths solely by mechanical symbol-shunting without any regard to meanings or ideas hidden in the shapes being manipulated) is a loop that allows such a system to "perceive itself", to talk about itself, to become "self-aware", and in a sense it would not be going too far to say that by virtue of having such a loop, aformal system _acquires a self_.

> Meaning comes in despite one's best effort to keep symbols meaningless!

#### Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering
> In its absolutely barest form, Godel's discovery involves the translation of an ancient paradox in philosophy into mathematical terms. That paradox is the so-called Epimenides paradox, or liar paradox. Epimenides was a Cretan who made one immortal statement: "All Cretans are liars." A sharper version of the statement is simply "I am lying"; or, "This statement is false". It is that last version which I will usually mean when I speak of the Epimenides paradox. It is a statement which rudely violates the usually assumed dichotomy of statements into true and false, because if you tentatively think it is true, then it immediately backfires on you and makes you think it is false.

The actual wording of the theorem is apparently not for mortal eyes, that's why we need 700+ pages, okay?
<blockquote>Godel's   Theorem   appears   as   Proposition   VI   in   his   1931   paper   "On   Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I." It states:  
<blockquote>To  every  ω-consistent  recursive  class  K  of  formulae  there  correspond  recursive  class-signs r, such that neither v Gen r nor  Neg (v Gen r) belongs to Fig (K) (where v is the free variable of r).</blockquote>  
Actually,  it  was  in  German,  and  perhaps  you  feel  that it might as well be in German anyway. So here is a paraphrase in more normal English:   
<blockquote>All consistent axiomatic formulations of number theory include undecidable propositions.</blockquote> 
</blockquote>

Grelling's paradox: 
> Divide the adjectives in English into two categories: those which are self-descriptive, such as "pentasyllabic", "awkwardnessful", and "recherche", and those which are not, such as "edible", "incomplete", and "bisyllabic". Now if we admit "non-selfdescriptive" as an adjective, to which class does it belong? If it seems questionable to include hyphenated words, we can use two terms invented specially for this paradox: autological (= "self- descriptive"), and heterological (= "non-self-descriptive"). The question then becomes: "Is "Is 'heterological' heterological?"

Grelling's paradox is particularly interesting to me. I come up with a couple more examples. The adjective "meaningless" is not meaningless. For it has a meaning: that it lacks meaning. The adjective "beyond words" is not beyond words. Because, ... need I say more?

In this section Hofstadter is talking about the notion of _metalanguage_, that we can transcend out of language and talk about it. "Meaningless" of course is meaningless within the system. Only by transcending out to the meta plane we observe that "meaningless" has a meaning.

#### Chapter II: Meaning and Form in Mathematics 
Euclid's proof for the infinitude of prime numbers:
> This proof works by showing that whatever number you pick, there is a prime larger than it. Pick a number-N. Multiply all the positive integers starting with 1 and ending with N; in other words, form the factorial of N, written "N!". What you get is divisible by every number up to N. When you add 1 to N!, the result <br>
can't be a multiple of 2 (because it leaves 1 over, when you divide by 2);<br>
can't be a multiple of 3 (because it leaves 1 over, when you divide by 3);<br>
can't be a multiple of 4 (because it leaves 1 over, when you divide by 4);<br>
. . .<br>
can't be a multiple of N (because it leaves 1 over, when you divide by N);<br>
In other words, N! + 1, if it is divisible at all (other than by 1 and itself only i
divisible by numbers greater than N. So either it is itself prime, or prime divisors are greater than N. But in either case we've shown the must exist a prime above N. The process holds no matter what number is. Whatever N is, there is a prime greater than N. 

#### Sonata for Unaccompanied Achilles
#### Chapter III: Figure and Ground 
#### Contracrostipunctus
The record player metaphor in this dialogue is a direct analogy for Gödel's theorem: Record player X cannot play a song called "I Cannot Be Played on Record Player X". Hofstadter explains the isomorphism of this analogy to Gödel's theorem in the following chapter.

#### Chapter IV: Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 
#### Little Harmonic Labyrinth
The meta-genie appearance here is hilarious and clever. A snippet:
> Achilles: Oh, thank you so very much, Genie. But curiosity is provoked. Before I make my wish, would you mind telling me who-or what- GOD is?<br>
Genie: Not at all. "GOD" is an acronym which stands "GOD Over Djinn". The word "Djinn" is used designate Genies, Meta-Genies, Meta-Meta-Genies etc. It is a Typeless word. <br>
Achilles: But-but-how can "GOD" be a word in own acronym? That doesn't make any sense!<br>
Genie: Oh, aren't you acquainted with recursive acronyms? I thought everybody knew about them. You see, "GOD" stands for "GOD Over Djinn"-which can be expanded as "GOD Over Djinn, O, Djinn"-and that can, in turn, be expanded to "G( Over Djinn, Over Djinn, Over Djinn"-which can its turn, be further expanded ... You can go as as you like.

#### Chapter X: Levels of Description, and Computer Systems 
>The idea that "you" know all about "yourself" is so familiar from interaction with people that it was natural to extend it to the computer-after all, it was intelligent enough that it could "talk" to them in English! Their question was not unlike asking a person, "Why are you making so few red blood cells today?" People do not know about that level -- the "operating system level" -- of their bodies.

>Consider, for example, the system whose 'hardware" is the earth's atmosphere (not very hard, but no matter), and whose "software" is the weather. Keeping track of the motions of all of the molecules simultaneously would be a very low-level way of "understanding" the weather, rather like looking at a huge, complicated program on the machine language level. Obviously it is way beyond human comprehension. But we still have our own peculiarly human ways of looking at, and describing, weather phenomena. Our chunked view of the weather is based on very high-level phenomena, such as: rain, fog, snow, hurricanes, cold fronts, seasons, pressures, trade winds, the jet stream, cumulonimbus clouds, thunderstorms, inversion layers, and so on. All of these phenomena involve astronomical numbers of molecules, somehow behaving in concert so that large-scale trends emerge. This is a little like looking at the weather and a compiler language.

>Similarly, and fortunately, one does not have to know all about quarks to understand many things about the particles which they may compose. Thus, a nuclear physicist can proceed with theories of nuclei that are based on protons and neutrons, and ignore quark theories and their rivals. The nuclear physicist has a chunked picture of protons and neutrons -- a description derived from lower-level theories buf which does not require understanding the lower-level theories. Likewise, an atomic physicist has a chunked picture of an atomic nucleus derived from nuclear theory. Then a chemist has a chunked picture of the electrons and their orbits, and builds theories of small molecules, theories which can be taken over in a chunked way by the molecular biologist, who has an intuition for how small molecules hang together, but whose technical expertise is in the field of extremely large molecules and how they interact. Then the cell biologist has a chunked picture of the units which the molecular biologist pores over, and tries to use them to account for the ways that cells interact. The point is clear. Each level is, in some sense, "sealed off" from the levels below it. This is another of Simon's vivid terms, recalling the way in which a submarine is built in compartments, so that if one part is damaged, and water begins pouring in, the trouble can be prevented from spreading, by closing the doors, thereby sealing off the damaged compartment from neighboring compartments. <br><br>
Although there is always some "leakage" between the hierarchical levels of science, so that a chemist cannot afford to ignore lower-level physics totally, or a biologist to ignore chemistry totally, there is almost no leakage from one level to a distant level. That is why people can have intuitive understandings of other people without necessarily understanding the quark model, the structure of nuclei, the nature of electron orbits, the chemical bond, the structure of proteins, the organelles in a cell, the methods of intercellular communication, the physiology of the various organs of the human body, or the complex interactions among organs. All that a person needs is a chunked model of how the highest level acts; and as all know, such models are very realistic and successful.

>Similarly, you might ask about a sprinter, "Where is the '9.3' stored, that makes him be able to run 100 yards in 9.3 seconds?" Obviously, it is not stored anywhere. His time is a result of how he is built, what his reaction time is, a million factors all interacting when he runs. The time is quite 'reproducible, but it is not stored in his body anywhere. It is spread around among all the cells of his body and only manifests itself in the act of the sprint itself.

#### Ant Fugue
>Anteater: Exactly. There is no natural mapping from the individual letters into the real world. The natural mapping occurs on a higher level between words, and parts of the real world. If you wanted to describe the book, therefore, you would make no mention of the letter level. <br>
Achilles: Of course not! I'd describe the plot and the characters, and so forth. <br>
Anteater: So there you are. You would omit all mention of the building blocks, even though the book exists thanks to them. They are the medium, but not the message.

Come to think about it, how I came to read this book is quite fortuitous: I was watching a Python Conference talk <[K. Lars Lohn, PyCon 2016 (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSfe5M_zG2s&feature=youtu.be)> and the speaker mentioned this book and I was intrigued. (This is not totally random. Because of its subject matter, this book is a popular reading for computer scientists.)

Again, "So, what is it about?", here is my best attempt: It's about Gödel's incompleteness theorem, explained in relation to parallels found in Escher's works and Bach's fugues, with implications and meanderings from from formal systems in mathematics, the nature of consciousness, to artificial intelligence.

"Can you explain to me what is Gödel's incompleteness theorem?" ... just read the book will you?
