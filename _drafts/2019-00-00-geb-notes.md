I have finished reading Douglas Hofstadter's _Gödel, Escher, Bach_, though I still don't know how to answer the question "What is it about?" in one sentence. I guess I can say it's mostly about Gödel's incompleteness theorem, but then I dread the rejoinder "Really? All 700+ pages of it?".

Maybe instead of trying to tell, I would show you my notes instead. Take a gander. 
 
#### Preface to _GEB_'s Twentieth-anniversary Edition
> ...<i>GEB</i> is a very personal attempt to say how it is that animate beings can come out of inanimate matter.

> What is an "I", and why are such things found (at least so far) only in association with, as poet Russell Edson once wonderfully phrased it, "teetering bulbs of dread and dream"... 

> ..."strange loop" notion holds the key to unraveling the mystery that we conscious beings call "being" or "consciousness".

> ...the Gödelian strange loop that arises in formal systems in mathematics (_i.e._, collections of rules churning out an endless series of mathematical truths solely by mechanical symbol-shunting without any regard to meanings or ideas hidden in the shapes being manipulated) is a loop that allows such a system to "perceive itself", to talk about itself, to become "self-aware", and in a sense it would not be going too far to say that by virtue of having such a loop, aformal system _acquires a self_.

> Meaning comes in despite one's best effort to keep symbols meaningless!

#### Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering
> In its absolutely barest form, Godel's discovery involves the translation of an ancient paradox in philosophy into mathematical terms. That paradox is the so-called Epimenides paradox, or liar paradox. Epimenides was a Cretan who made one immortal statement: "All Cretans are liars." A sharper version of the statement is simply "I am lying"; or, "This statement is false". It is that last version which I will usually mean when I speak of the Epimenides paradox. It is a statement which rudely violates the usually assumed dichotomy of statements into true and false, because if you tentatively think it is true, then it immediately backfires on you and makes you think it is false.

The actual wording of the theorem is apparently not for mortal eyes, that's why we need 700+ pages, okay?
<blockquote>Godel's   Theorem   appears   as   Proposition   VI   in   his   1931   paper   "On   Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I." It states:  
<blockquote>To  every  ω-consistent  recursive  class  K  of  formulae  there  correspond  recursive  class-signs r, such that neither v Gen r nor  Neg (v Gen r) belongs to Fig (K) (where v is the free variable of r).</blockquote>  
Actually,  it  was  in  German,  and  perhaps  you  feel  that it might as well be in German anyway. So here is a paraphrase in more normal English:   
<blockquote>All consistent axiomatic formulations of number theory include undecidable propositions.</blockquote> 
</blockquote>

Grelling's paradox: 
> Divide the adjectives in English into two categories: those which are self-descriptive, such as "pentasyllabic", "awkwardnessful", and "recherche", and those which are not, such as "edible", "incomplete", and "bisyllabic". Now if we admit "non-selfdescriptive" as an adjective, to which class does it belong? If it seems questionable to include hyphenated words, we can use two terms invented specially for this paradox: autological (= "self- descriptive"), and heterological (= "non-self-descriptive"). The question then becomes: "Is "Is 'heterological' heterological?"

Grelling's paradox is particularly interesting to me. I come up with a couple more examples. The adjective "meaningless" is not meaningless. For it has a meaning: that it lacks meaning. The adjective "beyond words" is not beyond words. Because, ... need I say more?

In this section Hofstadter is talking about the notion of _metalanguage_, that we can transcend out of language and talk about it. "Meaningless" of course is meaningless within the system. Only by transcending out to the meta plane we observe that "meaningless" has a meaning.

Euclid's proof for the infinitude of prime numbers:
> This proof works by showing that whatever number you pick, there is a prime larger than it. Pick a number-N. Multiply all the positive integers starting with 1 and ending with N; in other words, form the factorial of N, written "N!". What you get is divisible by every number up to N. When you add 1 to N!, the result <br>
can't be a multiple of 2 (because it leaves 1 over, when you divide by 2);<br>
can't be a multiple of 3 (because it leaves 1 over, when you divide by 3);<br>
can't be a multiple of 4 (because it leaves 1 over, when you divide by 4);<br>
. . .<br>
can't be a multiple of N (because it leaves 1 over, when you divide by N);<br>
In other words, N! + 1, if it is divisible at all (other than by 1 and itself only i
divisible by numbers greater than N. So either it is itself prime, or prime divisors are greater than N. But in either case we've shown the must exist a prime above N. The process holds no matter what number is. Whatever N is, there is a prime greater than N. 

#### Sonata for Unaccompanied Achilles
#### Chapter III: Figure and Ground 
#### Contracrostipunctus
The record player metaphor in this dialogue is a direct analogy for Gödel's theorem: Record player X cannot play a song called "I Cannot Be Played on Record Player X". Hofstadter explains the isomorphism of this analogy to Gödel's theorem in the following chapter.

#### Chapter IV: Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 
#### Little Harmonic Labyrinth
The meta-genie appearance here is hilarious and clever. A snippet:
> Achilles: Oh, thank you so very much, Genie. But curiosity is provoked. Before I make my wish, would you mind telling me who-or what- GOD is?<br>
Genie: Not at all. "GOD" is an acronym which stands "GOD Over Djinn". The word "Djinn" is used designate Genies, Meta-Genies, Meta-Meta-Genies etc. It is a Typeless word. <br>
Achilles: But-but-how can "GOD" be a word in own acronym? That doesn't make any sense!<br>
Genie: Oh, aren't you acquainted with recursive acronyms? I thought everybody knew about them. You see, "GOD" stands for "GOD Over Djinn"-which can be expanded as "GOD Over Djinn, O, Djinn"-and that can, in turn, be expanded to "G( Over Djinn, Over Djinn, Over Djinn"-which can its turn, be further expanded ... You can go as as you like.

Come to think about it, how I came to read this book is quite fortuitous: I was watching a Python Conference talk <[K. Lars Lohn, PyCon 2016 (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSfe5M_zG2s&feature=youtu.be)> and the speaker mentioned this book and I was intrigued. (This is not totally random. Because of its subject matter, this book is a popular reading for computer scientists.)

Again, "So, what is it about?", here is my best attempt: It's about Gödel's incompleteness theorem, explained in relation to parallels found in Escher's works and Bach's fugues, with implications and meanderings from from formal systems in mathematics, the nature of consciousness, to artificial intelligence.

"Can you explain to me what is Gödel's incompleteness theorem?" ... just read the book will you?
