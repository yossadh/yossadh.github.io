This book is quite different from my usual reading, which is mostly fiction, science-fiction, and popular science. This book is categorically a humanities book. In fact, some chapters were previously published in humanities journal. Nevertheless, I persevered through, since the subject is close to my heart (and my identity). Also, Ien Ang's writing is not boring academic prose. It is certainly not easy reading, but it is very readable and her personal stake in the subject also helps the process. The book is an academic, yet also personal, essay. 

### Introduction: between Asia and the West (in complicated entanglement)
>I must warn the reader that the spirit of the diasporic intellectual’s tactical interventionism runs throughout this book: the space from which these chapters were written was precisely the space of hybridity, between Asia and the West. At the same time, I hope to contribute to a reappreciation of the politics of hybridity – and its emphasis on multiplicity, uncertainty and ambivalence – which always seems to be at the heart of criticisms of the diasporic intellectual’s discourse.

>The idea of ‘Asia’ as a distinct, demarcatable region of the world originated in a very Eurocentric system of geographical classification. In their book The Myth of Continents, Martin Lewis and Kären Wigen (1997: 37) remark that ‘of all the so-called continents, Asia is not only the largest but also the most fantastically diversified, a vast region whose only commonalities – whether human or physical – are so general as to be trivial’. This is true, but it does not do away with the reality that in the contemporary world, ‘Asia’ and ‘Asians’ are powerful terms of identification for many cultures, societies and peoples who are somehow subsumed under these terms.

>The fact that identification with being Asian – sometimes in hyphenated form such as ‘Asian-American’ – is so ubiquitous across Western nation–states reveals much about the tension that exists between the two categories. Paul Gilroy (1993: 1) once remarked that ‘striving to be both European and black requires some specific forms of double consciousness’, pointing to the presumably unnatural quality of such an identity. The same can be said about being both Western and Asian, even though no _a priori_ similarity in the forms of double consciousness can be assumed between blacks of the African diaspora (of which Gilroy speaks) and Asians in the West, given the vastly different historical conditions under which Africans and Asians have entered Western space, in Europe, the Americas, and in Australasia (Chun 2001).

>The title of this book, On Not Speaking Chinese, articulates the subjective position from which the chapters collected here have been written: it signals a somewhat awkward, oblique relationship to a socially assigned ‘identity’ in a time when both identity claims and identity impositions of the essentializing kind are the order of the day. If there is an overarching theme throughout this book, then, it revolves around the multiple disjunctures and tensions between large-scale, publicly reproduced categorical identities – ‘Chinese’, ‘Asian’ – and the concrete social subjectivities and experiences which are shaped and circumscribed by these identity categories but at the same time always exceed their reified boundaries. In other words, there can never be a perfect fit between fixed identity label and hybrid personal experience; indeed, while the rhetoric of identity politics generally emphasizes the liberating force of embracing a collective identity, especially if that identity was previously repressed or oppressed, that very identity is also the name of a potential prison-house. It is very hard to imagine and appreciate the compli- cated entanglement of our togetherness-in-difference from within the prison-house of identity.

>Thus, while the transnationalism of diasporas is often taken as an implicit point of critique of the territorial boundedness and the internally homogenizing perspective of the nation–state, the limits of diaspora lie precisely in its own assumed boundedness, its inevitable tendency to stress its internal coherence and unity, logically set apart from ‘others’.6 Ultimately, diaspora is a concept of sameness-in-dispersal, not of togetherness-in-difference.

>Thus we have the ‘multicultural nation’ or the ‘multicultural state’, in which differences are carefully classified and organized into a neat, virtual grid of distinct ‘ethnic communities’, each with their own ‘culture’. The problem with this conception of the multicultural society is that it does not respond to the dynamism that occurs when different groups come to live and interact together, ‘tumbled into endless connection’ as Geertz put it. It is an all too ordered and well-organized image of society as a unity-in-diversity – a convenient image from a bureaucratic- managerial point of view, but problematic because it does not take account of forces, rampant in any complex, postmodern society, which are in excess of or subvert the preferred multicultural order. In other words, multiculturalism is based on the fantasy that the social challenge of togetherness-in-difference can be addressed by reducing it to an image of living-apart-together. Acknowledging this is one way to understand why multiculturalism has not been able to do away with racism: as a concept, it depends on the fixing of mutually exclusive identities, and therefore also on the reproduction of potentially antagonistic, dominant and subordinate others.

>Encapsulated here is the very paradox of hybridity: any identity can only be a temporary, partial closure, for there is always a ‘but’ nagging behind it, upsetting and interfering with the very construction of that identity. 

>In such a thoroughly postmodern context, what it means to be ‘Asian’ can no longer be defined or described in clear-cut, unambiguous terms despite the increased salience of the very term ‘Asian’ as a self-conscious marker of identity in the wake of identity politics.
