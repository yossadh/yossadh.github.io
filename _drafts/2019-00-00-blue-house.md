Finding science in literature
---
I wrote about how a verse in William Blake's _Auguries of Innocence_ illustrates ergodicity <[William Blake and the ergodic hypothesis](https://researcherblogski.wordpress.com/2016/05/30/william-blake-and-the-ergodic-hypothesis/)>. Rereading it, in retrospect, my tone was playful and irreverent.

I hereby want to clarify that I have great respect for literary works and it is such a wonder (for me) that as remote as it may seem, they can reflect some truth about the physical reality. 

And I am hardly alone in this wonderment. To wit, Ed Yong's recent book title [_I Contain Multitudes_](https://www.amazon.com/Contain-Multitudes-Microbes-Within-Grander-ebook/dp/B01824YMCM/) is an allusion to Walt Whitman's _Song of Myself_:

>Do I contradict myself?  
Very well then I contradict myself;  
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)

Without context, would one have guessed that the book is about _microbiome_, a multitude indeed, contained within us? I for one would have not. 

Do you see how brilliant this parallel is? Whitman's intended 'multitudes' are about mental constructions, while the microbiome, as much multitudinous, are tiny critters in our guts. But they are not Euclidean parallel that never the twain shall meet. Interestingly, both induce the philosophical question "What is self?" albeit one psychological and the other physiological. In other words, they converge.

Now I would like to mention another verse, which is Tomas Tranströmer's _The Blue House_. I learned about this poem from Cheryl Strayed, who quoted it in [advising a advice column reader](https://therumpus.net/2011/04/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-71-the-ghost-ship-that-didnt-carry-us/) about a big life decision (whether or not to have a child).

Interestingly, I went to live in Sweden a not long after that, and knowing a little Swedish gives a different flavour to my reading.
