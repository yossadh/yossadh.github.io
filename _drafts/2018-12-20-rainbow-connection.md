>All of us under its spell, we know that it's probably magic  
Have you been half asleep?  
And have you heard voices?  
I've heard them calling my name  
Is this the sweet sound  
That called the young sailors?  
The voice might be one in the same 
  
My most impressionable memory of seeing a rainbow happened in a tourist bus in Iceland. It was faint, like a watercolour painting on the canvas that was the pale blue sky and the treeless Icelandic landscape. I noticed it first, and a few minutes later the whole bus was teetering at one side of the bus, peering spellbound out of the window (except for the bus driver, I hope).

>Why are there so many songs about rainbows  
And what's on the other side?

This post has actually been simmering in my mind since I read [this paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0143-0807/37/6/063001/meta;jsessionid=7261FC35F9C0F500C705DA4198BDADAA.c1.iopscience.cld.iop.org) [[1](#ref1)], a review about rainbows in a physics journal! I was amazed by 1) how nice it is to have a comprehensive physical explanation of an everyday object in a journal article, 2) how complex the physics of rainbows is, and 3) potentially how much we don't know still about rainbows. It is such a formidable task to bring together the physics and fascination and wonder, and package it into a neat, coherent post. Here goes! 

The physics of rainbows can be very succinctly stated: rainbows are projections of light refracted by water droplets behind you, the observer. Now, that brief physics of rainbows have a lot of mind-blowing implications:

>Rainbows are visions  
But only illusions  
And rainbows have nothing to hide  

-   They _are_ optical illusions, since you need to be at certain angle with respect to the sunbeam and the water droplets. 
  >You've located intrinsic worth in the wrong place," she said to all of them, over the common band. "It's like a rainbow. Without an observer at a twenty-three-degree angle to the light reflecting off a cloud of spherical droplets, there is no rainbow. The whole universe is like that. Our spirits stand at twenty-three-degree angle to the universe. There is some new thing created at the contact of photon and retina, some space created between rock and mind. Without mind there is no intrinsic worth."  
– Kim Stanley Robinson, _Blue Mars_

  This means that you can't get your hands on the leprechaun's gold pot at the end of the rainbow; nor can you cross over to Asgard via the rainbow bridge Bifröst to say _hej_ to Odin/Thor/Loki. (Somewhere, someone is wearing a T-shirt saying "Science: ruining romance since 12xx").

- The xkcd comic above already mentions it: the rainbow is not a semicircle, it's a full circle. Most of the time we observe from too low an altitude that we don't see the other half. 

>What's so amazing  
That keeps us stargazing  
And what do we think we might see

- Another observer at slightly different position doesn't see the same rainbow. They would see refractions from another droplet that fits the angle at their position.

>So we've been told  
And some choose to believe it  
I know they're wrong, wait and see  

- If the droplet is small (e.g. in fog), the colours would not be well-separated, and you would see white rainbow (fogbow).
  Check out this article <[What the heck are white rainbows, and where do they come from?](https://www.popsci.com/where-do-white-rainbows-come-from)>.

>Who said that every wish  
Would be heard and answered  
When wished on the morning star  
Somebody thought of that  
And someone believed it  
And look what it's done so far  

- The droplet does not have to be raindrop, it can be ice crystals. I once saw a cousin of the rainbow, [polar stratospheric cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_stratospheric_cloud), in the Swedish Lapland. The iridiscence comes from diffraction by ice crystals, so one only sees this when the temperature is very cold (it was around -20°C as I recall). See [this article](https://blog.metservice.com/atmospheric-optics) for more atmospheric optical phenomena.

It's something that I'm supposed to be  
Someday we'll find it  
The rainbow connection
