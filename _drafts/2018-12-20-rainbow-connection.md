>All of us under its spell, we know that it's probably magic  
Have you been half asleep?  
And have you heard voices?  
I've heard them calling my name  
Is this the sweet sound  
That called the young sailors?  
The voice might be one in the same 
  
My most impressionable memory of seeing a rainbow happened in a tourist bus in Iceland. It was faint, like a watercolour painting on the canvas that was the pale blue sky. I noticed it first, and a few minutes later the whole bus was teetering at one side of the bus, peering spellbound out of the window (except for the bus driver, I hope).

>Why are there so many songs about rainbows  
And what's on the other side?

This post has actually been simmering in my mind since I read [this paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0143-0807/37/6/063001/meta;jsessionid=7261FC35F9C0F500C705DA4198BDADAA.c1.iopscience.cld.iop.org) [1], a review about rainbows in a physics journal! I was amazed by 1) how complex the physics of rainbows is, and 2) potentially how much we don't know still about rainbows. 

It is such a formidable task to bring together the physics and fascination and wonder, and package it into a neat, coherent post, but here goes!

>Rainbows are visions  
But only illusions  
And rainbows have nothing to hide  

Yep. Rainbows are optical illusions, projections of light refracted by water droplets behind you, the observer. This means that you can't get your hands on the leprechaun's gold pot at the end of the rainbow; nor can you cross over to Asgard via the rainbow bridge Bifröst to say hej to Odin/Thor/Loki. (Somewhere, someone is wearing a T-shirt saying "Science: ruining romance since 12xx").

Rainbows are an endless source of fascination. The science turns out to be very interesting, too -- this I didn't really appreciate fully when I was in high school physics class. So in this post I will give you the interesting scientific tidbits, then wax philosophical, as I am wont to do—


>You've located intrinsic worth in the wrong place," she said to all of them, over the common band. "It's like a rainbow. Without an observer at a twenty-three-degree angle to the light reflecting off a cloud of spherical droplets, there is no rainbow. The whole universe is like that. Our spirits stand at twenty-three-degree angle to the universe. There is some new thing created at the contact of photon and retina, some space created between rock and mind. Without mind there is no intrinsic worth."
– Kim Stanley Robinson, _Blue Mars_

So we've been told
And some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong, wait and see
Some day we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

Who said that every wish
Would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star
Somebody thought of that
And someone believed it
And look what it's done so far

What's so amazing
That keeps us stargazing
And what do we think we might see
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

All of us under its spell, we know that it's probably magic

Have you been half asleep?
And have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound
That called the young sailors?
The voice might be one in the same

I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me</blockquote>
