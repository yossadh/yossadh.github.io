I have been teaching swimming to a friend who is relatively a beginner. I often found myself having no words to describe a certain motion or posture and go "you just have to experience it with your body". While I do attribute this to my lack of training as a swimming instructor, I still think there are things that cannot be conveyed in words, especially when it comes to motoric stuff, don't you agree?
