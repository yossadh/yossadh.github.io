I have been teaching swimming to a friend who is relatively a beginner. I often found myself having no words to describe a certain motion or posture and go "you just have to experience it with your body". While I do attribute this partly to my lack of training as a swimming instructor, I still think there are things that cannot be conveyed in words, especially when it comes to motoric stuff, don't you think?

Anyway, thinking about this my mind wandered to the talk about failures in science. It's like this -- before I did my PhD I have of course heard things about the inevitable stress and failures (and I find myself saying the same thing to pre- and current PhD students too) but knowing it cognitively is different from experiencing it oneself, isn't it?
  
Here is a recent Nature article on the subject: <[Scientific progress is built on failure](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00107-y)>. Reading this, on one hand I hope that a PhD student or a prospective one takes note and does the necessary mental preparation; but on the other hand, I cannot help but go "My son, I know these things would fall on deaf ears. You just have to experience it for yourself".
