I am excited to learn that Sir Paul Nurse has an [upcoming book](https://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2020/11/what-is-life-understanding-biology-in-five-steps.html) attempting to discuss this perennial question. The title is of course an homage to Schrödinger's earlier treatise with the same title. I read that quite a while ago, and what was quite amazing was that it was written before the structure of DNA was known. 
I recall that I had attended a doctoral course with the same title as well. And the content was as broad as it suggests: the course coordinator invited outside speakers for talks, and often the talks were beyond mere biology, so it was a very interesting, thought-expanding, course.

The subtitle "Understanding biology in five steps" gives the central thesis: cells, genes, evolution, life as chemistry, life as information system. Information system is of course a very curious metaphor. Schrödinger was in the era of early computing -- how does our understanding of life now look like when examined in parallel to modern computing?

Nurse has [a 1-hour talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z-SUo2wP4I), which I watched with interest, so I am looking forward to read the book.
