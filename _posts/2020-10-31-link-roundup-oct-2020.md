>Do you need a little darkness to get you going? --Mary Oliver  
  
>He adopted the following strategy: say what you know; what you don’t know; what you are doing to find out; what people can do in the meantime to be on the safe side; and that advice will change --[Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03189-1)  
  
>In my work as a mediator, I’ve learnt that successful conversations always involve what I call a ‘gem statement’. When two parties have listened long and hard to each other – have made the heroic effort to listen curiously and empathically even when they disagree strenuously – someone eventually unearths a glowing, priceless gem. It usually takes the form of a short, powerful statement --[How to have a difficult conversation](https://psyche.co/guides/use-mediation-techniques-to-overcome-the-muck-of-blame-and-anger)  
  
>aside from faith,  
as far as you know,  
you will never have another heart.  
better to grow the one you were born with.
