It occurred to me that I'm trying to introduce mutations to my enzyme and here is the virus doing just that using the world as its test tube...What do you call this? Poignant? Amusing? Ironic?

>Do you need a little darkness to get you going? --Mary Oliver  
  
>He adopted the following strategy: say what you know; what you don’t know; what you are doing to find out; what people can do in the meantime to be on the safe side; and that advice will change --[Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03189-1)  
  
>In my work as a mediator, I’ve learnt that successful conversations always involve what I call a ‘gem statement’. When two parties have listened long and hard to each other – have made the heroic effort to listen curiously and empathically even when they disagree strenuously – someone eventually unearths a glowing, priceless gem. It usually takes the form of a short, powerful statement --[How to have a difficult conversation](https://psyche.co/guides/use-mediation-techniques-to-overcome-the-muck-of-blame-and-anger)  
  
>aside from faith,  
as far as you know,  
you will never have another heart.  
better to grow the one you were born with.
