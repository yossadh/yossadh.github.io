<summary>Lyrics: The answer</summary>
I believe You are the answer to every tear I’ve cried<br>  
I believe that You are with me<br>
My rising and my light<br>
Give me strength when I am weary<br>
Give me hope when I can’t see<br>
Through the crosses I must carry<br>
Lord, bind my heart to Thee<br>
That when all my days are over<br>
And all my chores are done<br>
I may see Your risen Glory<br>
Forever where You are<br>

I first heard the hymnal tune Thaxted in Corrinne May’s _The answer_. Her lyrics is a simple psalmic consolation, and paired with the simple tune, it proves to be indelible. The Methodist church I was worshipping at had it sung in the service a number of times. 
    
Just listen to it. The tune sounds…primal, that it was surprising to learn that Gustav Holst composed it in early 20th century. Initially a melody from a section of _Jupiter_ in  _The Planets_ suite, Holst adapted it to fit a patriotic poem _I vow to thee my country_ in 1921. Michael Perry composed another text for Thaxted _O God beyond all praising_ in 1982 “in response to a call for alternative words that would be more appropriate for Christian worship” <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>.   
<br>
Entire and whole and perfect, the service of my love;<br>
The love that asks no questions, the love that stands the test,<br>
That lays upon the altar the dearest and the best;<br>
The love that never falters, the love that pays the price,<br>
The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice.<br>
 <br>
And there's another country, I've heard of long ago,<br>
Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know;<br>
We may not count her armies, we may not see her King;<br>
Her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering;<br>
And soul by soul and silently her shining bounds increase,<br>
And her ways are ways of gentleness, and all her paths are peace<br>

1 O God beyond all praising,<br>
we worship you today<br>
and sing the love amazing<br>
that songs cannot repay;<br>
for we can only wonder<br>
at every gift you send,<br>
at blessings without number<br>
and mercies without end:<br>
we lift our hearts before you<br>
and wait upon your word,<br>
we honour and adore you,<br>
our great and mighty Lord.<br>
<br>
2* The flower of earthly splendor<br>
in time must surely die,<br>
its fragile bloom surrender to you,<br>
the Lord most high;<br>
but hidden from all nature<br>
the eternal seed is sown<br>
though small in mortal stature,<br>
to heaven's garden grown;<br>
for Christ the man from heaven<br>
from death has set us free,<br>
and we through him<br>
are given the final victory.<br>
<br>
3 Then hear, O gracious Saviour,<br>
accept the love we bring,<br>
that we who know your favour<br>
may serve you as our king;<br>
and whether our tomorrows<br>
be filled with good or ill,<br>
we'll triumph through our sorrows<br>
and rise to bless you still:<br>
to marvel at your beauty<br>
and glory in your ways,<br>
and make a joyful duty<br>
our sacrifice of praise.<br>
