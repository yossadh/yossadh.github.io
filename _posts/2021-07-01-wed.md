The sky cried her heart out<br>
tempestuously on Monday<br>
On Tuesday morning <br>
the tears kept falling<br>
percolating the slumbered<br>
It has slowed to rare droplets now<br>
But I wonder: <br>
with your grey countenance<br>
Do you still have more <br>
sadness to pour out?<br>
  
It is a gloomy day. The new COVID-19 cases today in the world is 208k, more than 1/4 of which are from Indonesia.
Singapore experienced a steep surge after a lull as well.
  
Here is another verse of consolation ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Stand_at_My_Grave_and_Weep)):
  
Do not stand<br>
By my grave, and weep.<br>
I am not there,<br>
I do not sleep—<br>
I am the thousand winds that blow<br>
I am the diamond glints in snow<br>
I am the sunlight on ripened grain,<br>
I am the gentle, autumn rain.<br>
As you awake with morning’s hush,<br>
I am the swift, up-flinging rush<br>
Of quiet birds in circling flight,<br>
I am the day transcending night.<br>
Do not stand<br>
By my grave, and cry—<br>
I am not there,<br>
I did not die.<br>
