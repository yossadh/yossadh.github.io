**Papers**  
[Nature \| Complete biosynthesis of cannabinoids and their unnatural analogues in yeast](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-0978-9)  
[PLoS Comp Bio \| Script of scripts: A pragmatic workflow system for daily computational research](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006843)  
This is like Makefile, but more user-friendly, you can switch languages easily, and is hosted in Jupyter notebook. If you constantly switch between bash, Python, R, and others; this is good to keep your workflow in one file. I think I don't need it at the moment.   
**Others**  
[A history of Singapore in 10 dishes](https://roadsandkingdoms.com/2019/a-history-of-singapore-in-10-dishes/)
