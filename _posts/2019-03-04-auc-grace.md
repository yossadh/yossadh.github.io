I wish I have an elegant solution for this like [automated linear regression](https://yossadh.github.io/posts/2019/02/linear-regression-grace/), but I don't. This solution that I came up with is hacky, but it works.
  
```bash
cat << EOF > integrate.par
integrate(s0)
EOF

grace data.agr -param integrate.par -saveall data.temp.agr -hardcopy -noprint
tail -2 data.temp.agr | awk 'NR==1{printf "%.2f\n", $2}'
```
  
In essence, call `integrate.par` to calculate the area under the curve of your data in `s0`. Grace will plot a cumulative sum and append it to the `.agr` file. So we just need to extract the last value of the cumulative sum, which can be found in the penultimate line (thus the `tail -2`). 
  
Told ya it's hacky.
