I'm trying to learn Markov state models for my MD analysis. I will put thoughts and notes here.
- There are 2 popular Python modules, PyEMMA and MSMbuilder. I'm sticking to PyEMMA at the moment because I had trouble installing the other
- [Intro to MSM by Frank No√©](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXppP_QTut8) 1h+, volume is a bit low
- [MSM for Simulation Analysis by Kyle Beauchamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pB3pUXULmo) ~20m
- [PyEMMA Jupyter notebook tutorials](http://www.emma-project.org/latest/tutorials/notebooks/00-pentapeptide-showcase.html) 
- Usually my eyes glaze over at statistical mechanics maths, but the [PyEMMA paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00743) is surprisingly very readable and easy to follow
