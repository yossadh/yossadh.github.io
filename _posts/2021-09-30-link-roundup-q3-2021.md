>the black mountain rises, a reference point  
to every human moment, utterly silent.  
No one climbs this mountain, there are no trails,  
because the place is holy: it does not exist to serve us,  
it is not meant to please us, it simply is,  
and in this way it is a god.<br><br>
Mountains do not move, and that is their mountainness.  
-- [Stephen Hollaway](https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2021/09/friday-poem-268.html)
  
>It is as unscientific to blindly trust scientists as it is to dismiss them.

>“For it must be understood that this is a children’s book only in the sense that the first of many readings can be undertaken in the nursery. Alice is read gravely by children and with laughter by grown ups; The Hobbit, on the other hand, will be funnier to its youngest readers, and only years later, at a tenth or a twentieth reading, will they begin to realise what deft scholarship and profound reflection have gone to make everything in it so ripe, so friendly, and in its own way so true. Prediction is dangerous: but The Hobbit may well prove a classic.”  
-- C.S. Lewis reviewing _The Hobbit_, The Times Literary Supplement, October 2, 1937
  
>Is a flower beautiful?  
Is a fruit perhaps beautiful?  
No: they merely have color and form  
And existence.  
Beauty is the name given to something that does not exist  
The name I give to things in exchange for the pleasure they give me.  
It means nothing.  
So why do I say of things: “They’re beautiful”?  
-- [Fernando Pessoa](https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2021/09/friday-poem-267.html)  
    
>Before 2.5 years, our brains are more fluid and plastic, enabling us to learn and adapt quickly, similar to the state of water flowing around obstacles. After 2.5 years, our brains are much more crystalline and frozen, still capable of learning and adapting but more like glaciers slowly pushing across a landscape.

>Richard Feynman, in a lecture entitled “There's plenty of room in the bottom: An invitation to enter a new field of physics” at the annual American Physical Society Meeting at Caltech on December 29, 1959, suggested that tiny, nanoscale machines could be constructed by manipulating individual atoms. Proteins are precisely such machines.

>Have you ever thought of the perfect quip or comeback after it didn’t matter—a minute, hour, or day after your conversation has ended?  
Well, there’s a name for that phenomenon. It’s called l’esprit de l’escalier, or the spirit of the staircase, and refers to the perfect retort that arises at the wrong time.
