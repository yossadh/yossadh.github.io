I've been following Inger Mewburn's blog [The Thesis Whisperer](https://thesiswhisperer.com/) since my PhD days. She and "The Whisper Collective" is organising a [conference](https://thesiswhisperer.com/2020/11/04/whisperfest-2020/) this year and I've signed up for a couple of sessions. I will post some stuff that I learn in this post.
