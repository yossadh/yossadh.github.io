I've been following Inger Mewburn's blog [The Thesis Whisperer](https://thesiswhisperer.com/) since my PhD days. She and "The Whisper Collective" is organising a [conference](https://thesiswhisperer.com/2020/11/04/whisperfest-2020/) this year and I've signed up for a couple of sessions. I will post some stuff that I learn in this post.

**Voices from the outside: Careers beyond academia**

Some tips:
- Subscribe to newsletters
- CV/Resume: 
    - 6 secs for recruiters to scan, and other things that we probably already know, but good to know _why_ they do that
    - Soft keywords -- can be overused e.g. team player
    - 3-4 pages
    - Don't use underlines, brackets
    - footer with date
    - save cover and CV together with filename NameLastDec2020.pdf (or .doc depending on req)
  
**Why academia shouldn’t be a competition**  
No idea how to summarise this. I feel encouraged, I guess? This touches on some soft aspects of being an academic that I'm not used to evaluate for myself. I think one takeaway is the perennial metric-ising everything problem. On one hand, translating human beings into numbers is a sort of reductionism, but on the other, how else one is supposed to do evaluations and comparisons? Stuff that comes to mind and some that was brought up: IQ, uni ranking, being a good mentor, not being toxic, being a good colleague.
