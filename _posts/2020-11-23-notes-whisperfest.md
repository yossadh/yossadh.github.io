I've been following Inger Mewburn's blog [The Thesis Whisperer](https://thesiswhisperer.com/) since my PhD days. She and "The Whisper Collective" is organising a [conference](https://thesiswhisperer.com/2020/11/04/whisperfest-2020/) this year and I've signed up for a couple of sessions. I will post some stuff that I learn in this post.

Some tips:
- Subscribe to newsletters
- CV/Resume: 
    - 6 secs for recruiters to scan, and other things that we probably already know, but good to know why they do that
    - Soft keywords -- can be overused e.g. team player
    - 3-4 pages
    - Don't use underlines, brackets
    - footer with date
    - save cover and CV together with filename NameLastDec2020.pdf (or .doc depending on req)
