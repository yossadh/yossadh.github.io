**We have no idea \| Jorge Cham and Daniel Whiteson ⭑⭑⭑⭑**  
A good popular science book. It is true that the jokes can be a bit too much (this is pointed out in many online reviews). What I want to point out is how the illustrations and the text meld so well together, corny jokes aside.

**Foreign Studies \| Shusaku Endo ⭑⭑⭑**  
This book was actually a farewell gift when I departed for Singapore 15 years ago (I guess the title is apt for the occasion). Only recently I rediscovered it in my parents' house (my level of English 15 years ago was not enough) and decided to read it. I found some sentences indeed mirror my own experience studying in foreign land. This book is not an easy reading since there hangs a certain gloomy heaviness to it. The titular "foreign studies" are not a joyful thing, but a source of discomfort, sadness, illness, and the like.   
I was also pleasantly surprised to find that he is also the author of _Silence_, which was in my to-read list. The topic, Jesuit missionaries and Christians enduring persecution in Japan circa 17th century, is even heavier.

## 2018
**Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid \| Douglas R. Hofstadter ⭑⭑⭑⭑⭑**  
Fascinating journey to comprehend Gödel's incompleteness theorem and meanderings to consciousness and artificial intelligence. Here is [my first impression](https://yossadh.github.io/posts/2018/12/revisiting-godel/) of sorts, and [my notes and highlights](link) (working on it; link will be updated)

**Python tricks: the book \| Dan Bader ⭑⭑⭑**  
I picked some tricks. But I think this book is better suited for more serious Python users, not a casual user like me.   

**2312 \| Kim Stanley Robinson ⭑⭑⭑**  
I think he can't outdo the epic Mars trilogy. But still a good read. Continuing the theme of interplanetary travel and human diaspora in the Solar system (the protagonist's hometown is in Mercury). What to say, humans will be humans, whether they venture to new lands or new planets -- I think this is the running thread in Robinson's novels.

**Westminster Shorter Catechism \| G I Williamson ⭑⭑⭑**
