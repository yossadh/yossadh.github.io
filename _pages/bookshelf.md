### To read
**The emperor of all maladies \| Siddhartha Mukherjee**  
tbu

### 2019
**Silence \| Shusaku Endo :star::star::star::star:**  
tbu

**On not speaking Chinese \| Ien Ang :star::star::star::star::star:**  
tbu

**We have no idea \| Jorge Cham and Daniel Whiteson :star::star::star::star:**  
A good popular science book. It is true that the jokes can be a bit too much (this is pointed out in many online reviews). What I want to point out is how the illustrations and the text meld so well together, corny jokes aside.

**Foreign Studies \| Shusaku Endo :star::star::star:**  
This book was actually a farewell gift when I departed for Singapore 15 years ago (I guess the title is apt for the ocassion). Only recently I rediscovered it in my parents' house (my level of English 15 years ago was not enough) and decided to read it. I found some sentences indeed mirror my own experience studying in foreign land. This book is not an easy reading since there hangs a certain gloomy heaviness to it. The titular "foreign studies" are not a joyful thing, but a source of discomfort, sadness, illness, and the like.   
I was also pleasantly surprised to find that he is also the author of _Silence_, which was in my to-read list. The topic, Jesuit missionaries and Christians enduring persecution in Japan circa 17th century, is even heavier.

### 2018
**Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid \| Douglas R. Hofstadter :star::star::star::star::star:**  
Fascinating journey to comprehend Gödel's incompleteness theorem and meanderings to consciousness and artificial intelligence. Here is [my first impression](https://yossadh.github.io/posts/2018/12/revisiting-godel/) of sorts, and [my notes and highlights](link) (working on it; link will be updated)

**Python tricks: the book \| Dan Bader :star::star::star:**  
I picked some tricks. But I think this book is better suited for more serious Python users, not a casual user like me.   

**2312 \| Kim Stanley Robinson :star::star::star:**  
I think he can't outdo the epic Mars trilogy. But still a good read.
