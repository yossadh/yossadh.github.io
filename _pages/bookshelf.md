**On not speaking Chinese \| Ien Ang ⭑⭑⭑⭑⭑**      
[[book notes](link)] (in progress)  
Only by reading first few chapters, I can already recommend every Chinese Indonesian, or anyone who identifies as part of a diaspora, to read it. Ien Ang's own life is in many ways parallel to mine and she put many things that I identify with into words. As a sociologist, her words are eloquent and her narrative fits into the larger sociologist context. Yet, she viewed her own life narrative not with distance, contrary to that, with personal vulnerableness.

## 2019
**Never Let Me Go \| Kazuo Ishiguro ⭑⭑⭑⭑**  
This is one of those where things are not what they seem and everything is only clear in the last 50 pages. If you find it a lull in the beginning like I did, just keep reading. The slow revelation is not dramatic like _A Clockwork Orange_ but will still leave one with retrospective reflection after things are fully revealed. 

**The two cultures \| CP Snow ⭑⭑⭑**  
[[book notes](https://yossadh.github.io/posts/2019/01/two-cultures-notes/)]

**Solaris \| Stanislaw Lem ⭑⭑⭑**  
Two words: _sentient ocean_. Need I say more?   
I guess I need. Indeed, the premise is very interesting. Lem decided to keep the ocean as impenetrably mysterious entity, though, which gives the book more of a thriller rather than sci-fi vibe. Good read but I am left wanting. 

**The traveler, the tower, and the worm: the reader as metaphor \| Alberto Manguel**  
A slender volume with self-explanatory title: Manguel expounds upon each of the three metaphors regarding the reader. It is an interesting to read about the act of reading itself. Manguel draws upon from a wealth of references from the Western literature canon, many works of which I haven't read, so it's not fair for me to give a rating.

<blockquote>Augustine had noted: “our spirit has two feet—one of the intellect and one of the affect, or of cognition and love—and we must move both so that we may walk in the right way.”<br> 
-- Saint Augustine, Sermon 36, 413, “Corpus Christanorum.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>There is, lurking at the core of every reader’s engagement with the text, a double bind: the wish that what is told on the page be true, and the belief that it is not. In this tension between both, readers set up their tenuous encampment. Bruno Bettelheim long ago noted that children do not believe in the Big Bad Wolf or in Little Red-Riding Hood as such: they believe in their narrative existence, which, as we all know, can have a greater hold on us than many characters of blood and bone. For most readers,
however, engagement with a text does not go beyond passionate daydreaming or wishful thinking.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...in that moment known to every true reader, in which a verse, a line of prose, an idea or a story, suddenly touches us, unexpectedly and profoundly, revealing something dark, half-intuited, unavowed, something that belongs exclusively to that reader to whom it has been secretly destined. That verse, sentence, or story will always interest us more than the material thing itself, because we are creatures of feeble perceptions, like moles in the sun, betrayed by our senses, and even though literary language is an uncertain, unreliable instrument, it is, however, capable, in in a few miraculous moments, of helping us see the world.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Being a bookworm need not always carry a negative connotation. We are reading creatures, we ingest words, we are made of words, we know that words are our means of being in the world, and it is through words that we identify our reality and by means of words that we are ourselves identified.</blockquote>

**Silence \| Shusaku Endo ⭑⭑⭑⭑**   
Very heavy topic, especially since it is a historical fiction, so the depictions are real. Endo captures best the tugging and struggles in the missionary's heart. Can Christianity really take roots in Japan? Are all the deaths during the persecution meaningful?   

**We have no idea \| Jorge Cham and Daniel Whiteson ⭑⭑⭑⭑**  
A good popular science book about things in the universe that are still unknown by modern physics. As pointed out in many online reviews, it is true that the jokes can be a bit too much. What I want to point out is how the illustrations and the text meld so well together, corny jokes aside. Jorge Cham's background as both physicist and cartoonist must have played a big role in that. The physics is explained at accessible level, though still it is not a very light reading.

**Foreign Studies \| Shusaku Endo ⭑⭑⭑**  
This book was actually a farewell gift when I departed for Singapore 15 years ago (I guess the title is apt for the occasion). Only recently I rediscovered it in my parents' house (my level of English 15 years ago was not enough) and decided to read it. I found some sentences indeed mirror my own experience studying in foreign land. This book is not an easy reading since there hangs a certain gloomy heaviness to it. The titular "foreign studies" are not a joyful thing, but a source of discomfort, sadness, illness, and the like. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that he is also the author of _Silence_, which was in my to-read list. The topic, Jesuit missionaries and Christians enduring persecution in Japan circa 17th century, is even heavier.

## 2018
**Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid \| Douglas R. Hofstadter ⭑⭑⭑⭑⭑**  
[[book notes](link)] (in progress)   
Fascinating journey to comprehend Gödel's incompleteness theorem and meanderings to consciousness and artificial intelligence. Here is [my first impression](https://yossadh.github.io/posts/2018/12/revisiting-godel/) of sorts.

**Python tricks: the book \| Dan Bader ⭑⭑⭑**  
I picked some tricks. But I think this book is better suited for more serious Python users, not a casual user like me.   

**2312 \| Kim Stanley Robinson ⭑⭑⭑**  
I think he can't outdo the epic Mars trilogy. But still a good read. Continuing from the Mars trilogy the theme of interplanetary travel and human diaspora in the Solar system (the protagonist's hometown is in Mercury). What to say, humans will be humans, whether they venture to new lands or new planets -- I think this is the running thread in Robinson's novels.

**Alice in Quantumland: An Allegory of Quantum Physics \| Robert Gilmore ⭑⭑⭑⭑**  
A lesson in quantum mechanics packaged in Alice's fantastical journey (or its Quantumland parallel). It is curiousest that the fantastical qualities in Wonderland parallel well to Quantumland weirdness.

**Westminster Shorter Catechism \| GI Williamson**
